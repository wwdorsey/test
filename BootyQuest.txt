IX. Pacifist Mode

========================

I. Ships

Ship Types (Models)
- Frigate (X for # of kingdoms, 3?)
- Galley (1)
- Sloop-of-war (2?)
- Sloop (2?)
- Ghost ship (Size?) (1)
- *Sloop-of-peace* (1)
[10 Total*]
[There was talk of a "Good Mode." Since modes are ship specific,
... need to attribute this to a particular model(s).
... This mode is just where you can't attack non-pirates
... and get more money for taking out/capturing pirates]

Weapons
- Cannon balls (Hull stuff, Multipliers maybe?)
... Possibly unlimited (probably)
... Gun sizes: Large, Medium, Small(2)
- Grape shot
- Fire bomb
... To damage seadogs, must set a system on fire
- Sail Shot
- Water Cannon - Used for putting out fires
- 1-5, Q-T - Keybindings to be used
- Deck guns? Would be used for grape shot and water cannon
... "Love pumpin' shit into hoes"
... Can be of all weapon types

Systems - All systems use 3 Seadogs max
- Weapons
- Masts - Dictate speed and evade
- Helm - No seadogs, just Named Chars
- Bilge Pump - Heals sinkmeter status
- Gang plank - Boarding
... [Boarding could have higher quality, faster gangplanks
... Wider bridges, more sturdy, higher health, fire retardant]

> Ship Upgrades
- System points
- Hull strength
- Seadog Capacity
- Personnel Weapon Upgrade

Augmentations
> Good Ones
- Crow's Nest
- Firing range (gunpowder)
- Improved rudder
- Hull iron plating (lower breach chance [and stronger intergrity?
... not flat dmg reduction, "resilience"])
- Fire resistant polymer (fire retardance)
- Cannon ball racks (automated-reloader-esque)
- Booty Implants (mo money)
- Improved Longevity (Improved Carpenter Tools)
- Cooking? Gourmet Kitchen? "Clean cauldron?" BAM!
- Fishing augmentation (1/3 - 1/4?)

> Area pacific augmentations
- Fur coats (increase morale in the north)
- NECISITO MAS

> Bad or Unsure About
- Anti-boarding augmentation
- Increased accuracy
- Compass Augmentation - helps nav (missing nodes, #s dependent)
- Some Kinda Shitty Weather Augmentation ***
- Pre-igniter (name sucks, might not use)

Combat
> Ballistics
- Hull segments, repairable but takes longer
... Green, Yellow, Red, Black
... If red, systems in that area are worn out
... If black, also taking on water
- 10 - 12 on biggest ship
- Hull segments lose a max of 5% max HP from 1 fight if taken
- Breaches? Repairable (Always on bottom deck (duh))
- Sink meter
- Autofire

> Boarding
- Right click Seadogs out of stations
- "Request all" on glangplank (HUD)
- As soon as gangplank locks, dudes cross a.f.a.p.
- Actual Combat - Named Char's take damage on ticks
... Seadogs and named chars are taken into account in an object
... This object considers the appropriate factors and begins
... killing seadogs based on these factors (ALMOST randomly)
... The amount of damage assigned to Named Chars needs to be clear
- Seadogs not moveable without a Full Retreat
- Named Chars totally moveable as normal
- The enemy either surrenders quick or takes you the distance
- If you retreat, they can follow, faster gang = faster retreat
- *** Try not to firebomb your own dudes (backs of ships better)
... We were unsure about firebombing stuff last I recall
- You can recall crewmates only
- You click on a crewmate and return him
- You can recall all
- If you retreat your seadogs take excess damage
- If you are boarded and don't want someone in a fight, you may
... send them below deck.
... If your top deck has nothing but enemies, you lose
- If you retreat and still in combat, your dudes will mill
... about gangplank AREA
- Seadogs/Crewmates removed from original combat object based on
... transit timer *Will require testing/calibration*
- If they want to hit you, they aim at gangplank system, vice versa
- Once they reach you, a new combat object is created
- The combat object's size and location is:
... # of dudes = volume, that area around gangplank
- So you can aim at that area and it will get hit, take fire damage


> Ship Movement
- Encounter ship
- Ship distance predetermined
- Can immdiately change direction, default is toward them
- Can rotate in place basically
- As soon as you start turning you can't shoot
- Can only move towards or away (Slight Y axis player can't see)

- Boarding orientation is a button, show up in each other's screen
- Small ships can run so you need to take out their sails or helm
... Presently, gangplanks prevent movement and fleeing
[Smaller ships just get missed a lot more?  This player would be
... more focused on boarding or simply surviving longer fights]
- Delay on gangplank so that they can't just molest

- May disengage at X distance - button pops up
- Leaving limits as far as running and next node selection
... That is, if you flee in the opposite direction, you can't
... jump to nodes that are in the other direction.
... Can still jump back if you want

II. Characters

Named Characters - These are normal, full-fledged, selectable
... characters.  They can start with no skill or some skill
... already leveled up.  They can be sent to any role to perform
... and level said role (aside from Doctor and Captain).

> Roles
- Captain - Somewhat of a token toon?
... Starts with level 1 Navigation & Melee
... If this toon dies, the game is over
... Upon a successful (yet tbd) run, may be able to continue?
- Navigator/Helmsman - Fewer Navs means chance of missing next jump
... Navs increase evade
... 3 Max per Helm area
- Weaponer - Stands in area with gun, does not work on it
... Higher quality increases gun speed and hit chance
- Cook - Big ole fat tub of lard
... To gain XP must stay at cooking station from start to end of
... a node visit.
... Better cook = better morale
... Multiple cooks?
- Carpenter - Repairs the ship systems and hull
... Higher quality = Faster repair
... Levels via work
- Doctor - Heals your crew
... Can not be trained up from a normal named char
... Must be bought at a port
... Levels by healing
... Higher level = faster heal
- Witchdocor?
... When not healing, emits an AOE "chant" that pacifies boarders
... This chant is disrupted upon taking damage
... All other aspects the same as a reg doctor

> Classes - There is talk of having Named Character Classes, but
... This needs fleshing out. So far:
- Some kind of strong melee class (Carribean)
- Perhaps stronger weapon specialization class

Seadogs
- Function as power
- Able to board enemy vessel
- Able to defend your vessel via melee combat (need callup button)
- Not directly targetable
- Intended to be rather expendable
- Replenish Seadogs at port or through seizure

======
======
======


III. Existence Mechanics

Game Over Conditions
- Captain + Seadogs = Acceptable
- Captain killed = Game Over
- Sink Meter reaching threshold = Game Over

Currencies
- $ (Doubloons) Gold, Paper, Bread, Dough, Chedda, Grip, Ends,
... Loot, Booty, Coin
- Ammo 1 - Grape Shot and Fire Bombs
- Ammo 2 - Sail Shot

Morale - NEEDS EXPANDING/CLARIFICATION
- Food (Better Chef > Better Food > Better Morale)
- Success
- Mermaids and Sirens

- Named toons never mutiny
- Meter next to sea dog count
- Threshold = chance of mutiny
- Below ~%50 they might, chance goes up as u go down,
... worse mutiny possible if lower #

======
======
======


IV. Progression Mechanics - Not complete at all, tech vs gameplay

Map
- Land procedurally placed first
- Land is images we already have
- Coordinates at the center of land with
... space around being known
- Procedurally generate remainging nodes
- Curved pathes finishing touch
[If you go to a zone multiple times, does it change? Just ocean
... nodes right? Ports stay where they were? Land?
... Can we have node CDs?]

Reputation
- We've done almost nothing for this

Events - These will happen (Prob needs own doc because so large)
> Sea monsters
- Giant Squid, Kraken
- Hydra

> Crystal Cove
- Procedurally placed
- Multi-node node?
- Lots of goodies
- Perhaps a boss, perhaps a chance of boss

> Mermaids & Sirens
- This node has one or the other, unkwown until player accepts
- If mermaids, simple morale increase (perhaps more)
- If sirens, morale increase but loss of X Seadogs (NCs?)
... Possible ship damage?

> Quests (& Management thereof)
- Bring homeboy 6 bags for sugar

> Weather - ***Needs hammering out***
- Bad weather increases chance of missing next jump
- May lower evade or lower hit chance or increase weapon CD
- May damage sails

> Stories
- Water cannon - Story, you use your water cannon to 
... save a burning ship OR
... you don't save them and salvage what you can
... Could grant dudes/sea dogs
... Could also be a trap .. maybe

End game
> Town Sacking Boss Fights
- ~2 Military ships
- Wall with guns and stuff

> Proposed Ideas
- Best-pirate battle
- Maybe just 2 modes (High Score and End game)
- Perhaps money amount at end

======
======
======


VI. Enemies

Ship Packages
- Aside from the standard attributes of a ship (i.e. Galley=Boarding)
... Enemy ships will have a somewhat standard set of packages
... Some parts can/will be randomized.
... This will be more properly fleshed out when the game is at a
... playable state.

Nations/Peoples/Zones
> Actual Nations
- Strongest Navy
- Strongest Mercantile, decent Navy,
... maybe easier to trigger military
- Weakest
- Starter, poorish, turns blind eye to piracy mostly
- Based on what you've done *Should have elaborated*
... could be friend if you hurt their enemy
... could be some kind of asshole bane thing
... Events from other areas decide this one

> Meta-esque stuff
- Peoples from the "Carribean" will be better boarders
- Peoples from the "Kingdoms" will have better guns

- "Andilar" (Silver Ships (Probly not actually silver))
- An area where there are boats that have snow.
... Story, your ship having no snow on it makes you stand out.

[Weaker regions may be more profitable. Less risky from boardings
... An algorithm where when you enter the zone a factor is picked
... Dictates overall booty value]

======
======

VIII. Other

Achievements
- "Messing Around In Boats" - Wreck X vessels (Something with many boats and perhaps being wreckless)
- "Sloop John B" OR "Let Me Go Home" OR "Why Won't They Let Me Go Home?" - Something about a very long trip (Probably for Sloop but I want for all ships :(  )
- "You Got Mega Junk In Yo Trunk" - Have lots of money at one time
- "Born To Hula" - P.M. - Use your music AOE to pacify X ships
- "Hit Me With Music" - P.M. - Prob better name for the above achievement
- "You've Got A Monster In Your Parasol" - Defeat every type of monster in a single run

General Visual Stuff
- Sails need a movement animation
- Sail holes and wear over time
- Need to grid stuff
- Smoke needs to be done intelligently

======
======
======


IX. Pacifist Mode
"Hit Me With Music"

> Ship
- Only in "Sloop-of-Peace"
- "Sloop-of-Peace" ship specs:
... Incredibly fast - fastest/very fast
... Finest rope - sails have increased durability
... Strong hull
- You expend morale for ship speed/evade ?
- Advanced map nav so picking is more strategic (Crow's Nest?)
- Groovy sail upgrades (maybe, appearance only atm)

> Systems
- Same as Normal except for no ballistic weapons or gangplank

> Goal
- Morale is your goal
- The challenge is in measuring how much/how far you can go
- Questing to find the tastiest grooves, finest herbs, and all
... the mermaids and sirens throughout the land - ocean that is
... Sirens for pirate people are bad because of their song
... But these dudes, they only get the good part of that
... And sirens have the tastiest of grooves

> Characters
- Regular named crewmen
... Need doctors, cooks, carpenters
- Band Members
... Guitar, Ukelele, Steel Drum, Drum, Horn, Singer, Bass

> Supplies
- Different supplies at different places from Normal Mode
- Supplies:
... Herbs
... Food & Flares
... Tune outposts for needed morale - may have herbs
... Tune outposts have long CD? Bounce around between visits?
- No herbs means no smoke AOE and decreasing morale (more rapidly?)
- You replenish these by sharing your tails of glory back at port
... This amount is linear to your morale

> Combat
- Running is sometimes a smart tactic
- Often, pirate ships won't attack you (not majority)
- "A typical combative approach":
... Wave flag?
... Shoot flares (when enemy looks about to shoot)
... Start the smoke (when close, limited amount or people pass out?)
... Start the jams
... Put out fires with bilge if you have
... Assess the situation, stay and maybe die, win, or run
- Morale for missed shots?
- Galleys will fuck you up, avoid unless confident/crazy

> "Weapons"
- Flares - Blinds enemies preventing shooting or
... increasing their miss chance
- Smoke Screen/AOE - This will increase evade and pacify the
... enemy ship overtime
- Musical AOE - Short range, better/more musicians increase effect
... Will make a sound
... Possibly different parts for each instrument
... ~3 Songs
- Water Cannon

> Questing
- Quests to search nodes for stuff. Clues? "North of X"
- Places may be guarded, can you slip past? (Survive combat)
- Is such an event worth it at this time?

> Events 
- Example: "You come upon a pod of dolphins. 
... That's totally cool. +10 Morale"
- Example: "You're ship has picked up... a bassist."

> Other Notes I Didn't Know Where To Put
- Always start in "Carribean"
... Harder because of boarders
... Kingdom areas are therefore better in the way of utilizing ship
