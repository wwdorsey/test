= Visual Workings of Boarding =
The actual combat of boarding is not in question here, just
 making it work visually.

* - A number that could be changed and isn't really consequential

==================================
Option #1 - Predesigned Animations
==================================

- Animations are already created for combat and pulled just like
 song files, animations of other objects

- Animations are done in increments of 5* units, and the animation
 used changes as the number of units in the combat object goes down

- The location of this animation is in relation to the gangplank

- The characters in the animation in no way represent the
 appearance of members of your crew

Questions/Concerns
- While out of boarding combat, the game is almost entirely
 visually indicative of what is going on (ex. If the Captain is at
 the helm, the Captain appears at the helm.) The only
 non-indicative thing I think of is seadogs just appear wherever
 they are rather than walking there.  I worry about bridging the
 gap from such visual correlation to a segment of gameplay where
 visual coorelation is more on the back burner.

- What happens when you recall just crew/dogs? How does the
 animation reflect that or does it at all?

	[-As crew/dogs are removed from combat the animation size changes to reflect the new size if it hits a min/max threshold (same as when crew/dogs die)]
 
- At what point do your crew/dogs change from looking like 
 themselves to just being an animation? When you board?
 What if you come back and they follow? What if you are boarded
 in the first place? Does your crew just change to a
 visually non-reprensitive animation when the fight starts?

	[-Crew changes as soon as they enter the area the fight occupies. 
	If you are boarding that means as soon as they cross the gangplank.
	If you are being boarded, crew on the main deck automatically move towards the fighting area and "enter" it once they reach the edge of the area.]
 
- How does the engagement animation play out? (Like the part where
 guys are still getting in position to fight each other.) This
 is not totally unique to just this topic so consider the answer
 for use on other options.
 
	[-We can break the the fight into 4 separate animation.
		1)Begining: Each side has a starting position (probably on opposite sides of the fighting area) and then walk towards each other.
		2)Fighting: Plays at the end of the Beginning animation. The kerfuffle gets into full swing with both sides throwing punches and shooting guns and swinging swords.
		3a)Death: Enough crew/dogs die off to reach the minimum threshold of the current animation.
				  Animated people that will be outside of the new fighting area "die".
				  The (2) animation for the new size beings.
		3b)Retreat: Enough crew/dogs are retreated to reach the minimum threshold of the current animation
					Animated people that will be outside of the new fighting area run away to either the gangplank or deck stairs depending on which ship they belong to.
					The (2) animation for the new size beings.]

- Some players do not care about their crew. "In FTL, my mantis
 is just a mantis." But for some people, attaching sentiment
 to crew is important. It gives the journey with that ship more
 character. Having the only visual indication of a crewmate
 become only the nameplate for them (and think of how often this
 would happen for a Carribean style ship) I believe would be
 unappealing to all players that do attach sentiment.
 
	[-Possible Explanations:
		-Those people are faggots
		-It's a confusing melee so it makes sense to lose track of some of your dudes.
	This is probably the biggest issue with this way of doing boarding.
	The way things stand, the only real way to deal with it is to ignore it or rework boarding completely. ]

Suggestions/Ideas
- The issue with bridging the gap and getting into position could
 be solved by making boarding combat more event-like. The player
 is given the impression that this is more of a mini-game. This
 removes the need for trying to properly animate the positioning
 of the fighters - they just would already be laid out correctly.
 They would not be thrown off by the stark contrast to the rest of
 the game as far as visual correlation goes because this is clearly
 an "event" and yada yada. I don't like this idea, I wanted all of
 combat to be a single, fluid engagement; but there it is.

- I had suggested something about loading the models of your crew
 into the animation so that people get to see their crew do stuff.
 As I recall, it sounded like the technical aspect of this would
 make the other options for this problem more worthwhile as a good
 bit of it would already be taken care of.

	[-With the way boarding works at the moment, there is a disconnect between a crew/dog's information and his animation.
	This makes loading a specifc model in place of a generic one hella sketcky at best and most likely impossible.]
 
Pros
- Never have to worry about too many units filling the ship or
 anything like that

- Less computationally intensive

	[-Also the "cleanest" way to code it. More effecient and easier to maintain and update.]

==================================
Option #2 - Chess Board
==================================

	[-I'm assuming this will all still be automated?]

- Named this way because I believe a large portion of the logic
 and code could be taken from a chess game and it matches various
 elements of this option.

- When the gangplank latches, the appropriate number of seadogs
 and the appropriate crewmates are inserted into the chess board

- The first (and 2nd?) node is on the gangplank itself. This node
 has an animation attached to it (Go to the first node on their
 ship)
 
	[-Contradiction with the previous point.
	If crew/dogs are already inserted into the chess board, to me that means they are one the enemy ship.
	Also I think the gangplank should not be apart of the board and fighting on the gangplank should be avoided.
	(To clarify: the gangplank "area" on a ship is fair game, but the gangplank itself should be off limits)]

- The nodes on their ship are in a chess board fashion.
 Each node tracks: 
 Occupied status (is/isn't occupied)
 Occupied status and friend/foe of 8 neighbor nodes
 End nodes know that there is no path in the appropriate directions

- Movement animations are pre-done. So units can either move
 L, R, U, D, UL, UR, DL, DR. They won't move where they can't
 because a node knows that it does or doesn't have an available
 neighbor to move to. 

- We are able to know what nodes are occupied throughout the
 board. Units fill in as needed.

- Given that filling in has been appropriately managed (addressed
 later), an occupied node detects what neighbors are hostile. The
 occupant faces that way and runs the attack animation. If the
 node this node is fixated on becomes unoccupied, it runs the
 check again. Attack appropriate node if possible, or move to
 a node where it can attack. Units can face at a 45 degree angle
 so as to attack diagonally.

- Crewmates keep track of the node they are in so that they appear
 there correctly. Seadogs wouldn't need this. We just need to know
 that a particular node is occupied by a seadog. But it may be 
 possible to do this for seadogs too since there is now a data
 structure in place to track them. All a node needs to know is
 that it is or isn't occupied and what faction they are on.

+ Continuation post-1st draft
 Another way to implement crewmate tracking:
 At most you need 21 unique names to occupy nodes. Captain is "1",
 next crewmate is "2", seadogs are all "21". Illustrate the
 cooresponding unit in that node. 

	[-what if you don't have a full complement of crew or choose not to send all crew over?]
 
- To prevent stupid looking collision, units cannot visually move
 through an occupied node. If they need to move between 2 occupied
 nodes, units are animated moving at .5 or -.5 of the node they are
 passing through. This should result in units at worst brushing
 shoulders. This could result in short periods where attackers
 appear to be attacking nothing, but they will quickly re-run the
 occupied neighbor check and respond accordingly.
 
	[-What about moving through multiple occupied nodes at once?]

- In the data structure, we can say that the first in (assuming
 it is a seadog) is the first to die and so on. FIFO. This provides
 additional realism since the first units will surely be taking
 the most damage.

Concerns
- Filling in. Same as with Option #1, I don't know how we want it
 to look. If they are in a U shape around the gangplank entrance,
 it would cause a bottle neck with insufficient outflow. We can
 have guys move past their U and essentially flank them, but I'm
 not sure I like this. Perhaps for smaller enemy groups. We could
 also just have them lined up and allow for fill room. This also
 provides for a more spread out melee. They could be lined in a
 fashion similar to a chess board where it's like:
 X0X0X0
 0X0X0X
 X0X0X0

	[-Neither side should be able to advance unless both sides are completely set up and ready to engage.
	This will give us control of the way crew/dogs are initially placed on the chess board so that we don't have to worry about gross concaves forming at the beginning of a fight.]
	
	More Concerns
	
	[-We can give crew/dogs outlines on how to move across the chess board, but at the end of the day we can't control where they end up.
	If crew/dogs can't move through occupied spaces blockages will occur, especially if we don't make the fighting area large enough. 
	(crew/dogs will get stuck behind friendly crew/dogs and will end up just sitting there)]
	
	[-What about retreating a crewmate from the object? Do they have to move to the edge of the fighting area? to their initial origin point?]
 
Ideas
- This idea might could still be used no matter what method we go
 with. For filling in purposes, a seadog (maybe crewmate too) - in
 this case lets say the 4th seadog in the boarding queue - will
 be animated walking to a mast, grabbing a rope, and swinging to
 "D5" on the enemy ship's chess board. Can't believe we didn't
 think of dudes doing heroic rope swings earlier lol. (See Bluto
 in Animal House).

==================================
Option #3 - Brrrnn
==================================

I had originally thought I knew of 3 options. I think the original
option 2 was actually the predcessor of the current option 2, but
will replace this if I think of a unique option.

==================================
Option #4 - Shogun Total War Stylie
==================================

- Full blown event. Fuck combat continuation. If there is boarding,
it starts this event. Dudes just appear on the appropriate ship
and go at it. Surely there is a way to load in the correct
crewmate models.

- The battle is either won or lost. Retreating still an option.
Retreat could result in a response event if one side boards the
ship of the retreating crew.

- Could remove the HUD and put both ships side by side and have
full 2 ship melee. Not sure about this. Would probly prefer
"aggressor vs defender" model.

- I believe you said this was how that game you played did it.

- I'm not fond of this idea. Prefer combat continuation like FTL.
