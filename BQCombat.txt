Here's some new stuff to include into the txt file. I'm not looking at the screen right now I wonder how bad this is?

]======[

]------[

Ship Types
- Sloop (1 Mast) [Bermuda Sloop]
- Sloop-of-War (3 Mast)
- Frigate
- "Adventure Galley" With oars. 160 men
- French frigate Félicité (1785) 600 men, 32 guns
- Brig
- Ghost Ship

"Systems"
- Weapons
- Masts
- Helm (benefit of manning during combat? evade?)
- Rutter?
- "Transporter"? Gang plank
- Captain's Quarters?
- Bilge Pump

Combat
- Hull segments, repairable but takes longer
- Hull segments lose a max of 5% max HP from 1 fight if taken
- Breaches? Repairable (Always on bottom deck (duh))
- Sink meter
- Movement
  - Can only move towards or away
  - Can rotate in place basically
  - Boarding orientation is a button,
  ..show up in each other's screen
- ? Small ships can run so you need to
... take out their sails or helm

{ FTL has so much differentition. Hmm.}

- Capture of Captain?

Weapons
- Cannon balls (Hull stuff, Multipliers)
... Possibly unlimited (probably)
... Cannon ball chain shot at mast
- Grape shot
- Fire bomb?
- Sail Shot
- 1-5, Q-T

Combat needs to be a bit different - more complex in areas
Boarding could have higher quality, faster gangplanks
Wider bridges, more sturdy, higher health, fire retardant

We absolutely need fire bombs of some sort

Water cannon!
-Story, you use your water cannon to save a burning ship OR
... you don't save them and salvage what you can
... Could grant dudes/sea dogs
... Could also be a trap .. maybe

Perhaps personnel weapons upgrades?

We need a concrete, intellegent way to send people to gangplank

Smaller ships just get missed a lot more?  This player would be
... more focused on boarding or simply surviving longer fights


Witchdoctors? Populous lol
Warrior prone ships?

Weaker regions may be more profitable. Less risky from boardings
An algorithm where when you enter the zone a factor is picked
Dictates overall booty value

*-Can you hit a bilgepump if it's in the middle of their lower deck?
- Need a smart way to target enemy systems on lower deck vs hull

Is there another ship? (May never need to be asked)
- No. Terminal to this ship's existence. Close object immediately.
... Unless we need to keep the ship there for returns if not killed
- Yes. Move to next case.

Will I be hostile to this ship?
- No. Present friendly dialogue.  Continue to next case.
- Yes. Continue to "@".

If they are approaching, a possible distance could be viewed
... as hostile. If threshold met:
- Fire warning shot.
- Proceed to @.

If I recieve damage, I'm being attacked.
If triggered:
- Flee.
- Proceed to @.

@ How will I proceed with my aggression? (Depends on kit)
- Attempt to board [B]
- Position ship to fire. [R]

>Trigger<
If a system has taken damage, send a Carpenter depending
on importance of said system.
- If we are set for boarding, Gangplank = #1
- If we are trying to position ourselves or flee, helm > masts 
- If we are already in firing position, weapons = #1
... Weapons may need innate values set (Cannons > Grapeshot > Water)
- If on fire, water cannon = #1
- If a breach, always #1, fix bilge if needed*

[B] Begin closing distance, assembling crew at Gangplank
- Who? Never captain. Prolly just need to have this set.
- As soon as in range, latch gangplank, start sending dudes

[R] Are they running?
- Yes, shoot helm or masts (random), or chase if needed
- No. Next Case.

Are they approaching / not in firing position?
- Yes, shoot masts, helm if in range. Target gangplank at X distance
- No. Proceed based on kit.
... If fire heavy, shoot fire at sails.
... If cannon heavy:
... Frigates, aim at their weapons > hull segments
... Others, hull segments

>Trigger<
If a gangplank has been latched
- Send crew to gangplank
- If X crew killed / Y ratio (of friendly to enemy crew)
... met, send captain
- If X1 crew killed / Y1 ratio met, surrender OR (random)
... fight to death
- If they flee
... If last status of combat object was Y2 ratio, pursue
... If Y3 ratio, return to battle stations
